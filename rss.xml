            <description><![CDATA[<p>I have three different remotes I use regularly with my TV set-up: one Set-top box remote, one Smart TV remote and finally my Apple TV remote. 

The remote for my Set-top box, which I the one I use daily, comes with 43 different physical buttons. I use only 12 of these buttons. The buttons I use are necessary for turning the TV on, navigating in the menus and adjusting the volume etc. Basically I use the buttons you would expect to find on any given remote. 

So from the current set of 43 buttons, I use 12, which leaves me with 31 unused buttons. You could say that one third of the buttons on a remote are necessary. But here a mindblowing surprise for you:

You only need 7 buttons on a TV remote. 

These are: Arrow up, arrow down, arrow left, arrow right, OK,  volume up and volume down. 

The rest of the buttons are unneccessary and can be replaced with clever UI and UX design in the development of software for TV’s. A simple example is the “OK” button on a remote. It serves as a confirmation button for a planned action, but it can also do more. When pressed, a window with buttons in the user interface guides the user forward.  

 
 



 

        











Look at your TV remote. How many buttons does it have? </p>]]></description>
